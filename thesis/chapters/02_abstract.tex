In the last decade, concepts from functional programming have grown in
importance within the wider, non-functional programming community.
Often it is recommended to learn a purely functional programming language
like Haskell to become familiar with these concepts.
However, many programmers struggle with the double duty
of learning a new paradigm and a new syntax at the same time. Because of
this, this paper explores the idea of learning purely functional programming % TODO: explores?
with a multi-paradigm programming language with a familiar syntax. The Go
programming language has been the choice for this due to its syntactical
simplicity and familiarity.

The absence of a list datatype in Go is remediated by Go's slices.
However, Go is missing the typical higher-order functions ---
`map', `filter' and `fold' to name a few --- that are present in every
functional programming language and many other programming languages too. Due to
this, the most popular higher-order functions have been determined and, because of the
absence of polymorphism in Go, implemented as built-in functions in the compiler.

Furthermore, this paper specifies a definition of what pure functional programming is and
introduces `funcheck', a static code analysis tool that has been designed and implemented to
report constructs that are non-functional.

With the help of the developed tools and extensions, Go proves itself to be
a suitable language for getting started with functional programming.
At the same time, it also shows why there is no way around learning a
language like Haskell if fluency with functional programming concepts
is desired.
