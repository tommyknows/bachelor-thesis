  - `common-list-functions`: See the thesis' appendix on what it is.
    Contains git submodules and a shell script to acquire the results

  - `examples`: contains different examples of functional Go code. Some code snippets
    are described in the thesis, some have been developed out of curiosity.
  - `funcheck`: git submodule that contains the implementation of `funcheck' as described
